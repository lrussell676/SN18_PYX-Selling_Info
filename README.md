As best I can, info is as accurate as this repo.

20/06/2021 (DMY); looks like main service here is new tyres and wheel alignment? I think this is the only significantly missing upload, though paper printouts will be provided 11/08/25 (D/M/Y) in person. 

Papers, with log book, will be provided tomorrow for this part exchange, and exchanged to the buyer.
